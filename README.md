# Experiments with C++

I will learn and develop projects with the programming language C++. 

Similar to how it's possible for a MERN stack application that uses MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS together, it's also possible to have software programs developed with C++ 
and other programming languages. For example, it's possible to develop an application using Swift and C++. Therefore, I will also store projects where I use C and other programming language together here.
